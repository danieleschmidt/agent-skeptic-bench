# Agent Skeptic Bench - Project Charter

## Executive Summary

Agent Skeptic Bench is a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to assess AI agents' epistemic vigilance, skepticism calibration, and resistance to deception. The project addresses critical gaps in AI safety evaluation by testing whether AI systems can appropriately challenge false claims, demand evidence, and maintain rational skepticism.

## Project Vision

**To establish the gold standard for measuring AI agents' ability to navigate uncertainty, detect deception, and maintain appropriate epistemic humility in adversarial environments.**

## Project Mission

We develop and maintain a rigorous, scientifically-validated benchmark that:
- Tests AI agents against curated adversarial scenarios
- Measures skepticism calibration and evidence evaluation capabilities
- Provides standardized metrics for epistemic vigilance
- Supports AI safety research and responsible deployment
- Promotes transparency in AI capability assessment

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **Lack of Skepticism Evaluation**: Existing AI benchmarks focus on accuracy but not appropriate skepticism
2. **Deception Vulnerability**: AI agents are susceptible to manipulation and false information
3. **Overconfidence Issues**: Many AI systems exhibit poor calibration of uncertainty
4. **Limited Adversarial Testing**: Insufficient evaluation against deliberate misinformation
5. **Inconsistent Standards**: No standardized framework for epistemic vigilance assessment

### Impact of Unaddressed Problems

- **Safety Risks**: Overconfident AI systems making critical decisions with insufficient evidence
- **Misinformation Spread**: AI agents amplifying false information due to poor skepticism
- **Trust Erosion**: Public confidence undermined by AI systems that can't detect deception
- **Research Gaps**: Limited understanding of AI epistemic capabilities and limitations
- **Deployment Risks**: Organizations deploying AI without understanding skepticism capabilities
