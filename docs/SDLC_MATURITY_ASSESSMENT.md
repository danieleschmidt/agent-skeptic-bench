## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Production Deployment**: No automated deployment pipeline increases risk of deployment errors
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Limited automated security scanning creates exposure
3. **Performance Issues**: Lack of performance monitoring may lead to undetected degradation
4. **Incident Response**: No monitoring/alerting delays incident detection and response

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **Dependency Management**: Manual dependency updates increase security and stability risks
2. **Code Quality**: Limited automated quality gates may allow regressions
3. **Scalability**: Unknown performance characteristics under load

### Low-Risk Areas
1. **Documentation**: Well-documented project reduces onboarding and maintenance risks
2. **Code Structure**: Good foundational structure supports future enhancements
