# ADR-001: Python as Primary Language for Agent Skeptic Bench

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Agent Skeptic Bench requires a language that can:
- Integrate with multiple AI/ML APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Handle asynchronous operations efficiently
- Support rapid prototyping and iterative development
- Provide robust data analysis and visualization capabilities
- Maintain strong community support for AI/ML tooling

## Decision
We will use Python 3.10+ as the primary development language for Agent Skeptic Bench.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Excellent ecosystem for AI/ML integration (transformers, langchain, etc.)
- Strong async support with asyncio for concurrent evaluations
- Rich data science libraries (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib)
- Extensive testing frameworks and tooling
- Large community and abundant documentation
- Rapid development and prototyping capabilities

### Negative
- Performance limitations compared to compiled languages
- GIL constraints for CPU-intensive parallel processing
- Potential dependency management complexity

### Neutral
- Requires Python 3.10+ for modern async features and type hints
- Development team needs Python expertise

## Implementation Notes
- Use pyproject.toml for modern Python packaging
- Leverage asyncio for concurrent AI model evaluations
- Implement proper dependency management with version pinning
- Use type hints throughout for better code quality
- Plan for performance-critical components to be optimized or potentially rewritten in Rust if needed
