# Compliance and Security Framework

This document outlines the compliance and security measures implemented in the Agent Skeptic Bench project.

## Security Compliance Framework

### SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts)

#### Level 1 - Build
- âœ… Scripted build process via GitHub Actions
- âœ… Provenance generation for releases
- âœ… Version control system (Git)

#### Level 2 - Source
- âœ… Version control with commit signing
- âœ… Hosted source code on GitHub
- âœ… Two-person review via pull requests

#### Level 3 - Build Platform Security
- ðŸ”„ Hardened build platform (GitHub-hosted runners)
- ðŸ”„ Isolated build environment
- ðŸ”„ Ephemeral environments

#### Level 4 - Review
- ðŸ”„ Two-person review of all changes
- ðŸ”„ Hermetic builds
- ðŸ”„ Reproducible builds

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework Alignment

#### Identify
- Asset inventory via dependency scanning
- Risk assessment through threat modeling
- Vulnerability identification via automated scanning

#### Protect
- Access control via GitHub permissions
- Data security through secrets management
- Protective technology via security tools

#### Detect
- Anomaly detection via monitoring
- Security monitoring through alerts
- Detection processes via CI/CD

#### Respond
- Response planning via incident procedures
- Communications through security policy
- Analysis via security reports

#### Recover
- Recovery planning via backup procedures
- Improvements via post-incident review
- Communications via status updates

## Dependency Management

### SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

Generate SBOM for compliance:

```bash
# Install SBOM tools
pip install cyclonedx-bom

# Generate SBOM
cyclonedx-py --output-format json --output sbom.json

# Validate SBOM
cyclonedx validate --input-file sbom.json
```

### Vulnerability Management

```bash
# Security audit
safety check --json --output vulnerability-report.json

# License compliance
pip-licenses --format=json --output-file license-report.json

# Dependency tree analysis
pipdeptree --json > dependency-tree.json
```

## Security Controls

### Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST)

Implemented via:
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Semgrep**: Multi-language static analysis
- **CodeQL**: GitHub's semantic code analysis
- **Ruff**: Fast Python linter with security rules

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

For web components:
- Container scanning with Trivy
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Runtime security monitoring (when deployed)

### Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- License compliance checking
- Known vulnerability detection
- Supply chain risk assessment

## Privacy and Data Protection

### Data Classification

- **Public**: Documentation, open-source code
- **Internal**: Development environments, test data
- **Confidential**: API keys, credentials, PII
- **Restricted**: Production data, security configurations

### Data Handling

- No PII collection in benchmark scenarios
- Synthetic data for testing
- Secure API key management
- Audit logging for access

## Regulatory Compliance

### Open Source Compliance

- MIT License compatibility
- Dependency license verification
- Attribution requirements
- Export control considerations

### AI/ML Compliance

- Model evaluation transparency
- Bias testing and mitigation
- Ethical AI guidelines adherence
- Responsible disclosure practices

## Audit and Monitoring

### Security Metrics

```yaml
# Key Performance Indicators
security_metrics:
  vulnerability_remediation_time: "< 30 days critical, < 90 days high"
  dependency_update_frequency: "weekly"
  security_test_coverage: "> 80%"
  incident_response_time: "< 4 hours acknowledgment"
  
compliance_metrics:
  sbom_generation: "automated with each release"
  license_scanning: "on every dependency change"
  security_reviews: "all pull requests"
  audit_trail_completeness: "100% for security-relevant actions"
```

### Continuous Monitoring

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Dependabot alerts
- CodeQL findings
- Container vulnerability scans
- License compliance checks

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process

1. **Detection** - Automated alerts or manual reporting
2. **Assessment** - Severity classification and impact analysis
3. **Containment** - Immediate threat mitigation
4. **Investigation** - Root cause analysis
5. **Remediation** - Fix implementation and testing
6. **Recovery** - Service restoration and monitoring
7. **Lessons Learned** - Process improvement

### Contact Information

- **Security Team**: skeptic-bench@yourdomain.com
- **Emergency**: Create GitHub security advisory
- **Non-critical**: GitHub issues with security label
