# GitHub Actions Workflow Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the CI/CD workflows recommended in the SDLC maturity assessment. The workflows should be manually created in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

## Required Workflows

### 1. Core CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing, security scanning, and quality checks

**Key Features**:
- Multi-Python version testing (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Pre-commit hook validation
- Security scanning (Bandit, Safety, Semgrep)
- Code coverage reporting
- Performance benchmarking
- Container security scanning
- Documentation building

**Implementation Priority**: **CRITICAL**

**Recommended Triggers**:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
    paths-ignore: ['**.md', 'docs/**']
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  workflow_dispatch:
```

### 2. Release Automation (`release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated package building and deployment

**Key Features**:
- Semantic versioning
- PyPI package publishing
- GitHub release creation
- Docker image building and publishing
- Changelog generation

**Implementation Priority**: **HIGH**

### 3. Security Monitoring (`security.yml`)

**Purpose**: Continuous security monitoring and vulnerability management

**Key Features**:
- Daily dependency scans
- CodeQL analysis
- Container vulnerability scanning
- Security advisory monitoring
- SBOM generation

**Implementation Priority**: **HIGH**

### 4. Performance Monitoring (`performance.yml`)

**Purpose**: Continuous performance monitoring and regression detection

**Key Features**:
- Benchmark regression detection
- Load testing validation
- Performance trend analysis
- Memory profiling
- API response time monitoring

**Implementation Priority**: **MEDIUM**

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core CI/CD (Week 1)

1. **Create base CI workflow**:
   ```bash
   # Copy template from docs/workflows/ci-workflow-template.md
   # Customize for project needs
   # Test with simple commit
   ```

2. **Configure secrets**:
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN` - Code coverage reporting
   - `PYPI_API_TOKEN` - Package publishing
   - `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN` - Container registry

3. **Validate workflow**:
   - Create test PR to verify all checks pass
   - Review security scan results
   - Confirm performance benchmarks execute

### Phase 2: Security Integration (Week 2)

1. **Enable GitHub security features**:
   - Dependabot security updates
   - Secret scanning
   - Code scanning with CodeQL

2. **Configure security workflow**:
   - Daily vulnerability scans
   - Security advisory notifications
   - SBOM generation and publishing

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3-4)

1. **Performance monitoring**:
   - Benchmark regression detection
   - Performance trend tracking
   - Load testing integration

2. **Release automation**:
   - Semantic release configuration
   - Automated changelog generation
   - Multi-platform container builds

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for AI API testing (optional in CI)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=...

# Development settings
AGENT_SKEPTIC_DEBUG=false
PYTHONPATH=/app/src
```

### Secrets Configuration

Navigate to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

```yaml
# Package Publishing
PYPI_API_TOKEN: pypi-...
TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN: pypi-...

# Container Registry
DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME: username
DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN: dckr_pat_...

# Code Coverage
CODECOV_TOKEN: codecov-token

# Optional: AI API keys for integration testing
OPENAI_API_KEY: sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: sk-ant-...
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY: ...
```

## Quality Gates

### Required Checks
- ✅ All tests pass (unit, integration, performance)
- ✅ Code coverage > 85%
- ✅ Security scans pass (no high/critical vulnerabilities)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks pass
- ✅ Type checking passes
- ✅ Documentation builds successfully

### Performance Gates
- ✅ No performance regression > 10%
- ✅ Memory usage within acceptable limits
- ✅ API response times < defined SLA

### Security Gates
- ✅ No critical or high CVE vulnerabilities
- ✅ All secrets properly managed
- ✅ Container scans pass
- ✅ Dependency licenses are compliant

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Success Metrics
- Build success rate > 95%
- Average build time < 10 minutes
- Security scan pass rate > 98%
- Test flakiness < 2%

### Alert Conditions
- Build failures on main branch
- Security vulnerabilities detected
- Performance regression > 15%
- Test coverage drops below 80%

## Rollback Procedures

### Failed Deployment
1. Immediately revert to last known good commit
2. Investigate failure in feature branch
3. Apply hotfix if critical
4. Full regression testing before re-deployment

### Security Issues
1. Immediately disable affected features
2. Apply security patches
3. Full security scan validation
4. Gradual rollout with monitoring

## Best Practices

### Workflow Maintenance
- Review and update workflows monthly
- Monitor for deprecated actions
- Keep security scanning tools updated
- Regular performance baseline updates

### Troubleshooting
- Use `workflow_dispatch` for manual testing
- Enable debug logging for investigations
- Preserve artifacts for failure analysis
- Document common issues and solutions
